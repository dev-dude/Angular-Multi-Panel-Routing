AngularJS Multi Panel Routing - Angular, Angular UI Compatible.
=========

This layout example allows developers to have multiple independent controller display panels in addition to the current state that the app is on.
A user can move between states and perserve content without creating messy and slow nested states.

The Problem with Angular UI Router is that you can only display one state on a page at a time. AngularJS Multi Panel Routing attempts to fix that.
